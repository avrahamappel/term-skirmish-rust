# Term Skirmish Rust ğŸ¦€

Term Skirmish Rust is a zero-player battle that takes place in your terminal. This project is a rewrite of Tom Steven's excellent [term-skirmish](github.com/tom-on-the-internet/term-skirmish).

## Why did you do this?

Because Rust [looks much better](screenshots/compare.md) in my editor.

Also I think it's probably faster (maybe)?
