# Term Skirmish Rust ğŸ¦€

Term Skirmish Rust is a zero-player battle that takes place in your terminal. This project is a rewrite of Tom's excellent [term-skirmish](github.com/tom-on-the-internet/term-skirmish).

## Why did you do this?

Because Rust looks much better in my editor. 

Rust:

Go:

Also I think it's probably faster (maybe)?
